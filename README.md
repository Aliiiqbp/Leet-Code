# Interview Preparation - Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is a comprehensive guide for preparing for technical interviews, focusing on data structures and algorithms. It covers various topics to help you strengthen your problem-solving skills and excel in interviews.

## Data Structures

1. **Arrays and Strings:**
   - Basic array operations and string manipulation.

2. **Linked Lists:**
   - Single linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists.
   - Operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

3. **Stacks and Queues:**
   - Implementing using arrays and linked lists.
   - Applications of stacks and queues.

4. **Trees:**
   - Binary trees, binary search trees.
   - Tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
   - AVL trees and balancing.

5. **Heaps:**
   - Min heap, max heap.
   - Heap operations and applications.

6. **Hash Tables:**
   - Hashing techniques and collision resolution.
   - Time complexity analysis.

7. **Graphs:**
   - Representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list).
   - Graph traversal (BFS, DFS).
   - Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford).

## Algorithms

1. **Sorting:**
   - Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort.
   - Merge sort, quicksort, heapsort.

2. **Searching:**
   - Binary search.
   - Linear search, interpolation search.

3. **Divide and Conquer:**
   - Binary search, merge sort, quicksort.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
   - Solving problems like the knapsack problem, the longest common subsequence.

5. **Greedy Algorithms:**
   - Activities selection problem, Huffman coding.

6. **Backtracking:**
   - N-Queens problem, Sudoku.

7. **Graph Algorithms:**
   - Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
   - Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford).

## Advanced Topics

   - Trie, Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree).
   - Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union).
